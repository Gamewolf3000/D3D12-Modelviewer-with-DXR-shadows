# D3D12-Modelviewer-with-DXR-shadows

A test project utilizing the D3D12 framework I am currently working on. Built using [Neo Steelgear Graphics Scene](https://github.com/Gamewolf3000/Neo-Steelgear-Graphics-Scene) which is built using [Neo Steelgear Graphics Core](https://github.com/Gamewolf3000/Neo-Steelgear-Graphics-Core).

In addition to using my framework I also added and experimented with inline DXR traced shadows as well as Assimp with manual mip map generations. Images of the application running can be viewed below.
